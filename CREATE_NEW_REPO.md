# Creating New GitHub Repository - Step by Step

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `DHF-JSCC-SNN`
   - **Description**: `Spiking Neural Network implementation of DHF-JSCC stereo image compression`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DON'T** initialize with README (we already have files)
   - **DON'T** add .gitignore (we already have one)
3. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Get Your Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DHF-JSCC-SNN.git
```

Copy this URL!

## Step 3: Update Remote and Push

Run these commands:

```bash
cd /home/past/sunny/DHF-JSCC-modified

# Update the remote URL to your new repository
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DHF-JSCC-SNN.git

# Push all commits
git push -u origin main
```

## Authentication

If prompted for credentials:
- **Username**: Your GitHub username
- **Password**: Use a **Personal Access Token** (NOT your password)

### Creating a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click: **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Give it a name: `DHF-JSCC-SNN-Push`
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click: **"Generate token"**
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

## Quick Copy-Paste Commands

Once you have your repository URL and token ready:

```bash
cd /home/past/sunny/DHF-JSCC-modified

# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DHF-JSCC-SNN.git

# Push (will ask for credentials)
git push -u origin main

# When prompted:
# Username: [your GitHub username]
# Password: [paste your Personal Access Token]
```

## Verify Success

After pushing successfully:
1. Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DHF-JSCC-SNN`
2. You should see:
   - All your files
   - Your commit: "Convert DHF-JSCC from CNN to SNN using SpikingJelly"
   - 22 files changed

## Optional: Update README

After pushing, you may want to:

```bash
cd /home/past/sunny/DHF-JSCC-modified
mv README_SNN.md README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README for SNN implementation"
git push
```

This replaces the README with the comprehensive SNN documentation.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "remote: Repository not found"
- Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first
- Check that the URL is correct (YOUR_USERNAME must match)

### Error: "Permission denied"
- Make sure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your password
- Check that the token has `repo` scope
- Verify the token hasn't expired

### Error: "Authentication failed"
- Generate a new Personal Access Token
- Make sure you copied it correctly (no extra spaces)

## What Will Be Pushed

✅ Included:
- All Python source code
- Configuration files
- Documentation (.md files)
- Utility scripts
- .gitignore

❌ Excluded (via .gitignore):
- Checkpoints (too large)
- Datasets (too large)
- Training outputs
- Python cache files
- Logs

Total size: ~1-2 MB (very manageable!)
