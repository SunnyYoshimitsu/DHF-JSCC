## To Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Create Your Own Fork
1. Go to: https://github.com/listen06/DHF-JSCC
2. Click "Fork" button (top right)
3. This creates: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DHF-JSCC
4. Then run:
   ```bash
   cd /home/past/sunny/DHF-JSCC-modified
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DHF-JSCC.git
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Push to Original Repository (Need Permission)
If you have write access to listen06/DHF-JSCC:
```bash
cd /home/past/sunny/DHF-JSCC-modified
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/listen06/DHF-JSCC.git
git push origin main
```

You may need to authenticate with a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Give it "repo" permissions
4. Use token as password when pushing

### Option 3: Create New Repository
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Create repository named "DHF-JSCC-SNN" (or any name)
3. Then run:
   ```bash
   cd /home/past/sunny/DHF-JSCC-modified
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DHF-JSCC-SNN.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Alternative: Create a Patch File
If you can't push directly, create a patch:
```bash
cd /home/past/sunny/DHF-JSCC-modified
git format-patch -1 HEAD
```
This creates a .patch file you can share or apply elsewhere.

## Current Remote Configuration
```
origin  https://github.com/SunnyYoshimitsu/DHF-JSCC.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/SunnyYoshimitsu/DHF-JSCC.git (push)
```

## Next Steps
1. Choose which option above works for you
2. Follow the instructions for that option
3. After successful push, verify on GitHub web interface
4. Optionally create a README with SNN experiment results
